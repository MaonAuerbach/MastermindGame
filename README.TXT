PROJECT TITLE: Mastermind
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To create a game where the user attempts to guess a 5 digit string of numbers. They are given the word "apple" in place of a correct number in a correct spot and the word "orange in place of a correct number in an incorrect spot. This was done using 3 separate classes. The first of these was called "Round" which initialized things such as the secret number, how many guesses the player has made, if they win or quit, ect while also creating methods to ask for their guess printing the results. The next class was the "Game" class which allowed the user to play multiple rounds and caluclated the average number of guesses between rounds. Lastly, there was a "Guess" class which checked if the guess was a valid 5 number guess that didn't repeat any digits and also checked if the numbers were in the right spot (apple) or the right number in the wrong spot (orange).
